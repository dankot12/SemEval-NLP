
In cosine similarity logic a document (i.e. a piece of text) is represented as a vector of all its terms (words), by using term frequency (or tf-idf, or variants thereof). 

accuracy on the test_data = number of successfull predictions * 100 / total number of predictions
			  = 1194 * 100 / 2718
			  = 43.94%
